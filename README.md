# exFetch

A fork of [xFetch](https://codeberg.org/XDR/xFetch) designed to look as good as possible.

## y

xFetch's main goal is simplicity, minimalism, and performance. In the performance regard, yeah, its pretty damn fast.

exFetch's main goal is performance, looks, maintainability and to be cross platform.

## Roadmap

At some point I hope to make this multi-platform.
