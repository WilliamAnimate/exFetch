# exFetch

A fork of [xFetch](https://codeberg.org/XDR/xFetch) designed to look as good as possible.

## y

xFetch is an extremely fast fetch but its kind of plain. This fork keeps its top tier speed (i think) and makes it look slightly better.

## Roadmap

At some point I hope to make this multi-platform.
